# Manifolds

This library is the first version I made but in "practice of programming", you learn to throw away the first version, reflect from the choices you made and improve it.

This library is powerful enough to do basic general relativity computations such as the Schwarchild spacetime - eg., [tutorial](https://nbviewer.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_basic_Schwarzschild.ipynb)

It can also do some basic things with the cosmological spacetime.

Once geodesics get implemented, this library will consist of a good base for general relativity computations.

Take a look at [Sage Manifolds](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/index.html) for a completed differential geometry librarry.
